To the memory of my grandfather, Dominick A. Rocco...

His wisdom was a guiding light through my most formative years.
The values he instilled were priceless; notably
patience, determination, strength, and compassion.
The caring he demonstrated was admirable; not just to those close to him,
but to all people.
The friendship he offered was fulfilling; hearts, minds, and souls
were throughly enriched by his love, wisdom, and laughter.
Along with the many others he touched, I would not be the person
I am without his influence.
In loving memory, I dedicate this work to him.
