\chapter{Glossary and Acronyms}
\label{app_glossary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Care has been taken in this thesis to minimize the use of jargon and
acronyms, but this cannot always be achieved.  This appendix defines
jargon terms in a glossary, and contains a table of acronyms and their
meaning.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Analog to Digital Converter} (\textbf{ADC}) -- A device which measures an analog response and produces a discretized value as output.

\item \textbf{Cosmic-Ray Muon} (\textbf{CR $\mu$}) -- A muon coming from
the abundant energetic particles originating outside of the Earth's
atmosphere.

\item \textbf{Hadron} -- A composite particle made of at least two quarks.  \textit{Mesons} such as pions and kaons are composed of one quark and one antiquark.  \textit{Baryons} are formed by some combination of three quarks or antiquarks.  Recently, more exotic states with four or five quarks have been observed in medium energy electron accelerators \cite{dias2013z_,barth2003evidence}.

\item \textbf{Quantum Efficiency} -- The fraction of photons which produce photoelectrons in a piece of light detection hardware such as a photo-diode or photomultiplier tube.
