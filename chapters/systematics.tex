\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{systs_chapter}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The extrapolated prediction depends on our knowledge of particle propagation
and detector behavior, mainly through the MC simulation.
Such dependencies introduce systematic uncertainties
when that knowledge is incomplete.
The design of \nova and its reconstruction chain is attempts to
mitagate systematic uncertainties.
For instance, a two detector design helps
cancel flux and cross section uncertainties; estimating muon energy
from range helps eliminate some dependence on calibration accuracy.
Despite these efforts, the degree to which systematic effects are mitigated
must be tested and residual behavior must be incorporated into the
analysis framework.


\section{Treatment of Systematic Uncertainties}

Systematic uncertainties are incorporated by allowing
event records to be altered in by an arbitrary procedure before
they are handled by the selection and analysis framework.
This process allows the analysis framework to produce selected spectra as if
each event were different in some systematic fashion.
Each event can also be assigned an alternate weight based
on entries in the event record, such as MC truth information or
the output of the reconstruction algorithms.
For each systematic effect, alternate versions of the FD prediction
are generated corresponding to $\pm 1\sigma, \pm2\sigma,$ and
$\pm3\sigma$ shifts \cite{backhouse2015cafana}.

The event records which are allowed to be shifted are populated by
the output of the reconstruction algorithms,
not the raw hit-by-hit detector readout itself.
Unfortunately, many of the systematic effects must be assessed by altering the
hit-by-hit detector readout.
In these cases, alternative MC samples are generated which
correspond to some systematic change in the behavior of the
simulation and/or reconstruction.
The effect of that systematic change is then
and parametrized in terms of some entry in the event record which
captures the behavior \cite{backhouse2015cafana}.

For each systematic effect, the shape of the
$\pm 1\sigma, \pm2\sigma,$ and
$\pm3\sigma$ shifts is interpolated using a cubic spline
\cite{atkinson1978introduction}.
The interpolation gives the fitter a smooth profile for marginalization.
In the Feldman-Cousins procedure \cite{feldman1998unified} (described
in Section~\ref{feldman_cousins_section}) that shape
is used for sampling the uncertainties in the pseudo-experiments
\cite{backhouse2015cafana}.

\subsection{Relative vs. Absolute Uncertainties}

In parametrizing systematic uncertainties between two detectors,
there is a distinction between uncertainties which are
correlated between detectors and those which have freedom to
move independently.
Neutrino cross section uncertainties, for instance, should be correlated
between the ND and FD; the physics which governs neutrino interactions
is not expected to change between Fermilab and northern Minnesota.
Uncertainty in the calorimetric energy scale, however,
might not be correlated between the two detectors.
There are systematic effects in the MC simulation and calibration procedure
which we have no evidence to believe behave similarly across
detectors.
In this analysis, systematic uncertainties which are correlated between
are referred to as \textit{absolute} uncertainties as opposed to
those which could be uncorrelated, which are called \textit{relative}
uncertainties.
Parameterized absolute uncertainties adjust the ND and FD prediction
simultaneously by the same amount,
Relative uncertainties, on the other hand, adjust the prediction by
the same magnitude, but in opposite directions.


\section{Flux Uncertainty}
\label{flux_syst_section}

The \numi beam simulation is used to predict the $\nu$ flux in both the
ND and FD, as described in Section \ref{beam_sim_section}.
Ultimately, these simulations enter in the analysis through the extrapolation
of the ND spectrum to produce the FD prediction.
It is thus necessary to estimate the systematic uncertainties in the flux
prediction.

Flux uncertainties are broken down into two categories; hadron-production
uncertainties and beam-transport uncertainties \cite{radovic2015beam}.
The hadron production uncertainty represents incompleteness in the modeling
of hadrons produced in the \numi target.
The beam transport uncertainties, on the other hand, relate to mis-modeling
of target facility components (horns, decay pipe, etc.) which could affect
the flux prediction.

Hadron-production uncertainty has been estimated by comparing the
standard FLUKA \cite{fluka}
cross-section model configuration to an alternative tune
which resolves discrepancies between NA49 \cite{gazdzicki2004report} data
and MC simulation \cite{radovic2015beam}.
The shift between the output of the two configurations was used to produce
band of systematic uncertainty as a function of true neutrino energy in both
detectors.
The FD uncertainty band can be seen in Figure \ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_fd},
ND in Figure \ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_nd}, and the ratio
of the two in Figure \ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_fd_nd_ratio}.
While the FD and ND bands are relatively large, the systematic uncertainty
cancels significantly in the ratio.

in the flux prediction, shown above.

the correlation between the two leads to significant cancellation.
}
\label{syst_param_beam_had_band_fd_nd_ratio}
\end{figure}

The beam-transport uncertainties have been estimated in a similar fashion.
Elements of the detector hall have been alternatively configured
in order to estimate the resulting flux uncertainty \cite{radovic2015beam}.
The following alternative configurations were tested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Horn current shifted by $\pm$1 kA (0.5\%)
\item Horn 1 position shifted by $\pm$2 mm in both transverse dimensions
\item Horn 1 position shifted by $\pm$2 mm in in both transverse dimensions
\item Current distribution in horn switched from linear to exponential
with skin depth 0.77 cm
\item Beam position on target shifted by $\pm$0.5 mm in both
transverse dimensions
\item Beam spot size on target shifted by $\pm$0.2 mm in both
transverse dimensions
\item Target position shifted by $\pm$2 mm in longitudinal dimension
\end{itemize}
These alternative configurations have been used to produce systematic
uncertainty bands analogous to the hadron production bands
shown in Figures \ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_fd},
\ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_nd}, and
\ref{syst_param_beam_had_band_fd_nd_ratio}.

For both the ND and FD, the systematic uncertainty bands have been combined
to produce one total flux uncertainty band \cite{radovic2015beam}.
The band is used to reweight the true energy spectrum
in forming the FD prediction.
The effect of the flux uncertainty reweighting can be seen in
Figure \ref{syst_fig_allBeam}.

\section{Cross Section Uncertainty}

\genie includes a built in utility for reweighting events based on
uncertainties in the free parameters of its cross section models
\cite{genie}.
For each free parameter, event weights are determined by recalculating the
cross section with that parameter altered;
the weight is taken to be the ratio of the altered cross section
to the altered one.
At analysis time, selected events in the ND and FD MC predictions can be
reweighted on an event-by-event basis.
There are 67 parameters which can be adjusted independently which are listed
in Table~\ref{genie_reweight_knobs}.

\end{table}

Certain parameters are matched with shape-only
and/or normalization-only counterparts to separately illustrate
those effects.
Since these effects would be redundant, these parameters
are excluded from the reweighting process.
All redundant parameters are listed in Table
\ref{redundant_genie_knobs}.


Marginalizing over the large number of free parameters in \genie
would be an expensive operation.
Rather than including all parameters, only the ones
with the most significant effect were given an independent treatment.
These parameters are MaCCQE, MaCCRES, MvCCRES, MaNCRES, and MaNCEL.
The effect of MaCCQE on the prediction and confidence intervals
can be seen in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaCCQE},
MaCCRES in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaCCRES},
MvCCRES in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MvCCRES},
MaNCRES in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaNCEL},
and MaNCEL in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MvNCRES}.

The remaining parameters were grouped together by summing the
$\pm1\sigma$  bin shifts in quadrature.
Between $\pm$ shifts, the larger of the two was included in the sum.
Sums were determined separately for signal and background spectra and
for each detector.
These sums can be visualized in Figure \ref{syst_param_sum_small_genie_fd} for
the FD and Figure \ref{syst_param_sum_small_genie_nd} for the ND.
The effect of the combined systematic uncertainty on the
prediction and confidence intervals can be seen in Figure
\ref{syst_fig_numuSumSmallGENIE}.

\section{Particle Propagation Uncertainty}

Simulating neutrino interactions in \nova includes propagating
secondary particles\footnote{
Particles produced in the neutrino interaction}
through the detectors.
This process is subject to uncertainties in the models involved, which mainly
those involving interactions with atomic nuclei \cite{folger2004binary}.
The \geant package can be configured to operate with different
\textit{physics lists} which each represent a different set of interaction
models.
In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty, the \nova MC was
configured to run with four different alternative physics lists:
QGSP\_BIC\_HP, FTF\_BIC, FTFP\_BERT, and QGSC\_BERT.
Each of these physics lists is described in Section \ref{geant_section}.

Using the sample generated with each physics list, an
alternative ND MC prediction was generated.
The beam peak was fit with a truncated normal distribution in the range
of 1.25 GeV to 2.75 GeV to extract the mean and normalization.
The parameters extracted were compared to the nominal ND MC
prediction and used to estimate the effect of the systematic uncertainty.
See Figure \ref{syst_param_nd_QGSP_BIC_HP} for the fit and prediction for
QGSC\_BIC\_HP,
Figure \ref{syst_param_nd_FTF_BIC} for FTF\_BIC,
Figure \ref{syst_param_nd_FTFP_BERT} for FTFP\_BERT,
and Figure \ref{syst_param_nd_QGSC_BERT} for QGSC\_BERT.
The largest shifts came from QGSC\_BIC\_HP, which were just shy of 1\%.
Thus, the systematic was included in the analysis framework as a 1\%
shift in normalization weight and a 1\% energy scale factor.
The effect of the energy scale on the prediction is displayed
in Figure \ref{syst_fig_geantScale}
and the normalization shift in Figure \ref{syst_fig_geantNorm}.

\label{birks_shift_table}
\end{table}


As discussed in Section \ref{geant_section}, \nova simulation
models scintillation production using Birks' law \cite{birks1951scintillations}
with a corrections from \cite{chou1952nature}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dX} = L_0  \frac{\frac{dE}{dX}}{1+ k_B \frac{dE}{dX} + k_C \frac{dE}{dX}^2}.
\end{equation}
The free parameter $L_0$ sets the absolute scale for light production
as a function of energy deposition per path length \dedx,
while $k_B$ and $k_C$ are free to capture any nonlinearity.
$L_0$ is effectively absorbed by downstream simulation and covered
by the calorimetric energy uncertainty in Section \ref{syst_cal_section}.
Uncertainty in $k_B$ and $k_C$, however, must be treated independently.
The values
 $k_B = 0.04~\text{cm} / \text{MeV}$ and $k_C = -0.0005~\text{cm}^2 / \text{MeV}^2$
were tuned using comparisons between ND data and MC.
Two alternative samples were generated with different samples of $k_B$ and
$k_C$.  The first sample has $k_B = 0.02~\text{cm} / \text{MeV}$ and $k_C = 0$;
the second has $k_B = 0.01~\text{cm} / \text{MeV}$ and $k_C = 0$.
The value of 0.01 is motivated by measurements \cite{tretyak2010birks}
of $k_B$ in organic scintillators.


In a manner similar to the particle propagation uncertainty,
the FD MC prediction for each shifted sample was fit
with a truncated normal distribution;
the mean and normalization
were extracted from the fit and interpreted as an energy
scale and normalization shift.
A comparison of the fits is shown in Table \ref{birks_shift_table}.
A 2\% uncertainty is taken on both the reconstructed energy scale
and normalization.

Since the tuning was performed using ND data, we have no knowledge how well
these parameters match FD data.
As such, the energy scale and normalization factor are each
represented by a separate relative and absolute uncertainty.
The effect of the absolute normalization uncertainty is shown in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_birksNormRel},
the relative normalization uncertainty in Figure~\ref{syst_fig_birksNormRel},
the absolute energy scale uncertainty in Figure~\ref{syst_fig_birksScaleAbs},
and the relative energy scale uncertainty Figure~\ref{syst_fig_birksScaleRel}.

\label{calib_shift_table}
\end{table}

The calorimetric energy scale is determined independently for both detectors
and both for data and MC.
In the extrapolation procedure, it is assumed that the calorimetric energy
scale between data and MC has been determined accurately.
Studies of muon activity in the ND has shown that the calorimetric
energy scales can differ by as much as 4\%.
Accurate calorimetry also relies on the attenuation and
cell-to-cell effects to have been properly calibrated out.
In order to test the effects of such effects on the reconstruction,
a suite of alternative calibration samples have been constructed.
Two samples were created by adjusting the absolute energy scale
up and down by 5\% \cite{lein2015thesis}.
Another sample was produced by adjusting the attenuation curve for
each cell up and down by a random factor drawn from a normal distribution
with a spread of 0.8\%.
The final sample was produced by modifying the slopes of the attenuation
fits amounting to a 20\% deviation at the far end of the cell.


Again, the systematic uncertainty has been estimated by observing
the effect of these shifts.
In each case, a truncated normal distribution was fit to the
shifted FD MC prediction.
The fit results are compared to a fit to the nominal FD prediction
in Table~\ref{calib_shift_table}.
The fit for the the $\pm$5\% shifts can be seen in Figures
\ref{syst_param_flat105cal} and \ref{syst_param_flat095cal}, respectively.
Figure \ref{syst_param_randomcal} shows the random calibration
shift sample and Figure \ref{syst_param_slopecal} shows the slope
shift sample.
Both the random and slope shifts show small effects on
the mean energy and normalization;
this makes sense since the shifts can average out across the
detector.
The 5\% energy scale shifts, however, lead to a significant
systematic effect.
Both the normalization and energy scale were seen to deviate from the
nominal prediction by $\pm2$\%.
The energy scale shift is smaller than the full 5\% since calorimetry
only enters in estimation of the hadronic energy;
the energy of the muon track is estimated from range and thus insensitive
to calorimetric energy variations.

Thus, the calorimetric energy uncertainty is included in the analysis
as a 2\% normalization shift and 2\% energy scale.
Both of these are taken as both relative and absolute.
The effects of the absolute and relative normalization shift
can be seen in Figures \ref{syst_fig_calNormAbs} and
\ref{syst_fig_calNormRel}, respectively.
Similarly, the absolute and relative calibration scale
can be seen respectively in Figures \ref{syst_fig_calScaleAbs} and
\ref{syst_fig_calScaleRel}.

\section{Detector Mass Uncertainty}

Proper modeling of detector mass is a requirement of the extrapolation
procedure; if it were incorrect, exposure of the MC prediction could
be inconsistent with data.
The uncertainty has been estimated in \cite{raddatz2016thesis}
by taking uncertainties on each detector component in terms of linear density
of cells.
The result is shown in table \ref{detector_density_table}.
In each detector, the uncertainty in density is 0.7\%.

A separate accounting from \cite{musser2014mass} compared
the total mass of both the simulated and physical FD.
That study produced an discrepancy of 0.8\%

Those two uncertainties have been combined as a
1\% overall normalization uncertainty, both absolute and relative.
The effect of the absolute uncertainty is shown in
Figure \ref{syst_fig_massNormAbs} and the relative uncertainty in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_massNormRel}.

\section{Muon Range Uncertainty}

The uncertainty in detector composition described in the previous section
could induce discrepancy in the observed range traversed by muon tracks.
As described in Section \ref{energy_section} length of the muon track enters
directly into the reconstructed energy estimate.
To compensate for this dependence, a systematic uncertainty
of 1\% of the track energy estimate has been applied.
In the ND, the effect is enhanced by a 2\% uncertainty on the
amount of steel in the muon catcher \cite{raddatz2016thesis}.
As such, the uncertainty in the ND is taken as 2\% rather than 1\%.
The effect of the FD muon range uncertainty is visible in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_trkLenFD};
the corresponding ND effect is shown in Figure~\ref{syst_fig_trkLenND}.

\section{Hadronic Energy Uncertainty}

As shown in Figure~\ref{nd_selected_hadE}, the reconstructed hadronic
energy distribution agrees poorly between the ND prediction and data.
Hadronic energy enters directly in the reconstructed neutrino energy,
which is also shown to disagree in Figure~\ref{nd_selected_numuE}.
Depending on which is taken as the denominator,
the means of the ND predicted and data hadronic energy spectra
differ by 12\%.
The source of this discrepancy is not understood.
It may arise from an incomplete description of the interaction model
in \genie which distorts the observed spectra.
Alternatively, the discrepancy may be caused by improper detector modeling.
Since the cause is not understood, we take this discrepancy as a
systematic uncertainty.
The effect is represented as 12\% uncertainty on the hadronic
component of the reconstructed neutrino energy, both absolute and relative.
The effect of the absolute uncertainty is shown in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_hadEAbs} and the relative uncertainty in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_hadERel}.
The hadronic energy uncertainty is by far the largest uncertainty in this
analysis.

\section{Negligible Uncertainties}

Certain uncertainties have been investigated and deemed to be negligible in
this analysis.
The uncertainty in protons-on-target (POT) accounting was estimated
by comparing the primary \numi intensity monitor to upstream intensity
monitors in the Main Injector and found to be remarkably stable
\cite{radovic2015beam}.
Studies of the effect of dead channels (APD pixels) involved randomly masking
off up to 10\% of channels and observing the result in reconstruction \cite{jose2015badchan}.
The effect of these masks was found to be negligible.

\section{Total Systematic Uncertainty}

All of the individual systematic uncertainties are combined in the final prediction.
The combined effect of all systematic uncertainties can be seen in
Figure~\ref{syst_fig_syst}.
