\section{Monte Carlo Simulation}
\label{sim}

The \nova simulation chain involves many components to deliver an accurate representation; starting with protons on the \numi target and running all the way through APD readout in the \nova detectors.  FLUKA and FLUGG are used to simulate the flux in the NuMI beamline.  \cite{fluka}  Neutrino interactions are simulated using \genie.\cite{genie}  \geant is used to propagate products of the neutrino interactions through a detailed model of the \nova~detectors.\cite{geant}  Custom NOvA simulation software converts energy depositions into electronic signals.


\subsection{Beam Simulation}


Stuff here.  Gotta figure out what.

\subsection{\genie -- Neutrino Interaction Simulation}



\genie is a comprehensive neutrino MC generator for the experimental physics community.  According the \genie collaboration mission statement, the generator aims to simulate processes  for all neutrino species and all nuclear targets, from the MeV to PeV scale.  Nuclear structure is at the core of neutrino interaction simulation, for which \genie uses  Relativistic Fermi Gas model of Bodek and Ritchie.  \cite{bodekritchie}  At low energies, this gives a reasonable approximation of nuclear binding energies and struck nucleon momentum.  At higher energies, it provides a model for shadowing and other effects.

Neutrino interaction cross sections broadly form one of the most important components of neutrino event generation.

Reweight abilities.

\subsection{\geant -- Daughter Propagation}

Daughter particles are propagated through detector.  \geant handles propagation of particles, decays, hadronic interactions, electromagnetic interactions, knock ons, etc.

\subsection{Photon Transport}

Photons are transported from the point of energy deposition to the  readout.  Ray tracing.  Attenuation.


\subsection{Readout Sim}

Count photons in cell.  Convert to ADC.  Do sag.  Add this noise, that noise, some other noise.  Run DCS alg.
