Neutrinos at the Main Injector (\numi) is a high intensity neutrino source located at Fermilab.  The \numi Off-axis \nue Appearance (\nova) experiment will use this source to measure~parameters associated with neutrino oscillation.  This paper will give an introduction to neutrino physics, including a technical overview of its history and an explanation of oscillation phenomena.  Recent results will be reviewed and the \nova experiment will be described in detail.  Finally, this paper will present the outline of an analysis to measure the muon neutrino survival probability and parameters \thetatth and \deltamtht.
