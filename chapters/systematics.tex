\chapter{Systematic Errors}
\label{systs_chapter}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The extrapolated prediction depends on our knowledge of particle propagation
and detector propagation, mainly through MC simulation.
Such dependencies introduce systematic errors when that knowledge is incomplete.
The design of \nova and its reconstruction chain is aimed at mitigating
systematic errors.
For instance, a two detector design helps
cancel flux and cross section uncertainties; estimating muon energy
from range helps eliminate some dependence on precise calibration.
Despite these efforts, the degree to which systematic errors are mitigated
must be tested and and their effect must be incorporated into the
analysis framework.


\section{Treatment of Systematic Errors}

Systematic errors are incorporated by allowing
event records to be altered before they are handled by the
selection and analysis framework.
This process allows the analysis framework to see the analysis as each
event were different in some systematic fashion.
Each event can also be assigned an alternate weight based
on entries in the event record, such as MC truth information or
the output of the reconstruction algorithms.
For each systematic error, alternate versions of the FD prediction
are generated corresponding to $\pm 1\sigma, \pm2\sigma,$ and
$\pm3\sigma$ shifts.

The event records which are allowed to be shifted are populated by
the output of the reconstruction algorithms,
not the raw hit-by-hit detector readout itself.
Meanwhile, many of the systematic effects must be assessed by altering the
hit-by-hit detector readout.
In these cases, alternative MC samples are generated which
correspond to some systematic change in the behavior of the
simulation and/or reconstruction.
The effect of that systematic change is then
and parametrized in terms of some entry in the event record which
captures the behavior.

For each systematic error, the shape of the
$\pm 1\sigma, \pm2\sigma,$ and
$\pm3\sigma$ shifts is interpolated using a cubic spline
\cite{atkinson1978introduction}.
The interpolation gives the fitter a smooth profile for marginalization.
In the Feldman-Cousins procedure \cite{feldman1998unified} (described
in Section~\ref{feldman_cousins_section}) that shape
is used for sampling the errors in the pseudo-experiments.

\section{Flux Uncertainty}
\label{flux_syst_section}

Come back to this one.


\section{Cross Section Uncertainty}

\genie includes a built in utility for reweighting events based on
uncertainties in the free parameters of its cross section models
\cite{genie}.
For each free parameter, event weights are determined by recalculating the
cross section with that parameter altered;
the weight is taken to be the ratio of the altered cross section
to the altered one.
At analysis time, selected events in the ND and FD MC predictions can be
reweighted on an event-by-event basis.
There are 67 parameters which can be adjusted independently which are listed
in Table~\ref{genie_reweight_knobs}.

\caption{Redundant knobs in \genie Reweight}{
Certain parameters in \genie are paired with shape-only or normalization-only
counterparts.
These counterparts are excluded in this analysis since they are redundant.
This table shows the list of parameters which are excluded and the parameter

\label{redundant_genie_knobs}
\end{table}

Certain parameters are matched with shape-only
and/or normalization-only counterparts to separately illustrate
those effects.
Since these effects would be redundant, these parameters
are excluded from the reweighting process.
All redundant parameters are listed in Table
\ref{redundant_genie_knobs}.


Marginalizing over the large number of free parameters in \genie
would be an expensive operation.
Rather than including all parameters, only the ones
with the most significant effect were given an independent treatment.
These parameters are MaCCQE, MaCCRES, MvCCRES, MaNCRES, and MaNCEL.
The effect of MaCCQE on the prediction and confidence intervals
can be seen in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaCCQE},
MaCCRES in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaCCRES},
MvCCRES in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MvCCRES},
MaNCRES in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MaNCEL},
and MaNCEL in in Figure \ref{syst_fig_MvNCRES}.

The remaining parameters were grouped together by summing the
$\pm1\sigma$  bin shifts in quadrature.
Between $\pm$ shifts, the larger of the two was included in the sum.
Sums were determined separately for signal and background spectra and
for each detector.
These sums can be visualized in Figure \ref{syst_param_sum_small_genie_fd} for
the FD and Figure \ref{syst_param_sum_small_genie_nd} for the ND.
The effect of the combined systematic can be seen in Figure
\ref{syst_fig_numuSumSmallGENIE}.

\section{Particle Propagation Uncertainty}

Simulating neutrino interactions in \nova includes propagating
secondary particles\footnote{
Particles produced in the neutrino interaction}
through the detectors.
This process is subject to uncertainties in the models involved, which mainly
those involving interactions with atomic nuclei \cite{folger2004binary}.
The \geant package can be configured to operate with different
\textit{physics lists} which each represent a different set of interaction
models.
In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty, the \nova MC was
configured to run with four different alternative physics lists:
QGSP_BIC_HP, FTF_BIC, FTFP_BERT, and QGSC_BERT.
Each physics list is described in Section \ref{geant_section}.

Using the sample generated with each physics list, an
alternative ND MC prediction was generated.
The beam peak was fit with a truncated gaussian in the range
of 1.25 GeV to 2.75 GeV to extract the mean and normalization.
The parameters extracted were compared to the nominal ND MC
prediction and used to parameterize the systematic error.
